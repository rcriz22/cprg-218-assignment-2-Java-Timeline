                    <p id="description">Steve Jobs, or Steven Paul Jobs, was the co-founder and CEO of Apple and introduced the iPhone. Jean-Marie Hullot, who worked at NeXT and later at Apple, had the idea of an Apple phone. 

                    The iPhone is more than just a smartphoneâ€”it is one of the most influential devices of this generation.  It transformed how we communicate, work, live and interact with technology. Since the first iPhone was released, it has become a symbol of innovation and modern technology. 

                    Each iPhone brought something new from introducing touchscreens and apps to features like FaceID and of course, a better camera!</p>
